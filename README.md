# WarrantyTracker
This Warranty Tracker application was a project I set out to accomplish as a way to learn and to help the company I'm interning for. My workplace needed a better way to keep track of our warranty claims that didn't include writing them on a white board, so I used my knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript to build this template. Since it's inception (04/2022) it has recorded and facilitated over 200 warranty claims (as of 07/2023), decreasing the average warranty repair timeline from an average of 3 days, down to only 1 day now.
