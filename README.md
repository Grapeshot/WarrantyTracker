# WarrantyTrackerProject
Warranty Tracker Project was a project I set out to accomplish as a way to learn and to help the company I'm interning for. My workplace needed a better way to keep track of our warranty claims that didn't include writing them on a white board, so I used my knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript to build this template.
