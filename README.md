# WarrantyTrackerProject
Warranty Tracker Project was a very simple project I set out to accomplish over a weekend. My workplace needed a better way to keep track of our warranty claims that didn't include writing them on a white board, so I used my very basic knowledge of HTML and CSS to build this very rough template. I then worked my way through a Javascript course and pulled things I needed to use to build out this project.
